        "1. **What is a RESTful API?**  \n",
        "   A RESTful API (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for designing networked applications. It uses HTTP requests to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on resources. It is stateless, meaning that each request from the client to the server must contain all the information the server needs to fulfill that request.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Explain the concept of API specification**  \n",
        "   An API specification defines the structure, methods, and responses of an API. It acts as a blueprint or contract that ensures consistency and allows developers to understand how the API should behave. Examples of API specifications include OpenAPI and Swagger.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **What is Flask, and why is it popular for building APIs?**  \n",
        "   Flask is a lightweight, Python-based web framework used to build web applications and APIs. It's popular because of its simplicity, flexibility, and ease of use. Flask doesn’t come with many built-in features, allowing developers to pick and choose what libraries and tools they want to integrate.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **What is routing in Flask?**  \n",
        "   Routing in Flask refers to the mechanism that maps a URL to a Python function. This function is executed when a request is made to that URL. For example, when a user accesses a certain path in a web app, Flask routes the request to a function that processes it and returns a response.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **How do you create a simple Flask application?**  \n",
        "   A simple Flask application can be created by installing Flask and defining a basic route. Here's an example:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   from flask import Flask\n",
        "\n",
        "   app = Flask(__name__)\n",
        "\n",
        "   @app.route('/')\n",
        "   def hello():\n",
        "       return 'Hello, World!'\n",
        "\n",
        "   if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
        "       app.run()\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **What are HTTP methods used in RESTful APIs?**  \n",
        "   Common HTTP methods in RESTful APIs are:\n",
        "   - `GET`: Retrieve data.\n",
        "   - `POST`: Create data.\n",
        "   - `PUT`: Update data.\n",
        "   - `DELETE`: Delete data.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **What is the role of Flask’s session object?**  \n",
        "   Flask’s session object is used to store data across requests for a particular user. It is often used for storing user-specific information like login status or preferences, and is typically stored on the client side in a secure cookie.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. **What is the purpose of the @app.route() decorator in Flask?**  \n",
        "   The `@app.route()` decorator in Flask maps a URL path to a Python function. This function is executed whenever the specified URL is accessed via the specified HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.).\n",
        "\n",
        "9. **What is the difference between GET and POST HTTP methods?**  \n",
        "   - `GET` is used to retrieve data from the server without making any changes. It is idempotent (the result of the operation is the same regardless of how many times it’s repeated).\n",
        "   - `POST` is used to submit data to the server, often causing a change (like creating a new resource).\n",
        "\n",
        "10. **How do you handle errors in Flask APIs?**  \n",
        "   Errors in Flask can be handled using custom error handlers or by using the `abort()` function. Flask also provides status codes to indicate errors (e.g., `404 Not Found`, `500 Internal Server Error`).\n",
        "\n",
        "11. **How do you connect Flask to a SQL database?**  \n",
        "   Flask can be connected to a SQL database using SQLAlchemy or other database connectors. You first configure a URI for the database and use an ORM (like SQLAlchemy) to interact with the database.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. **What is the role of Flask-SQLAlchemy?**  \n",
        "   Flask-SQLAlchemy is an extension for Flask that simplifies working with SQL databases. It provides an Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) to interact with relational databases in a more Pythonic way, allowing developers to define models and interact with the database using Python objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. **What are Flask blueprints, and how are they useful?**  \n",
        "   Flask blueprints allow you to organize your application into multiple components or modules. Each blueprint can define its own routes, views, templates, and static files, making the app easier to manage and extend.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. **What is the purpose of Flask's request object?**  \n",
        "   The `request` object in Flask is used to access data from incoming HTTP requests, such as form data, query parameters, JSON payloads, and headers.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. **How do you create a RESTful API endpoint using Flask?**  \n",
        "   A RESTful API endpoint can be created in Flask by defining routes with appropriate HTTP methods. For example:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   @app.route('/api/resource', methods=['GET'])\n",
        "   def get_resource():\n",
        "       return jsonify({'message': 'Resource data'})\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "16. **What is the purpose of Flask's jsonify() function?**  \n",
        "   `jsonify()` is a Flask utility that converts data (like dictionaries) into a JSON response, which is the standard format for APIs.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. **Explain Flask’s url_for() function.**  \n",
        "   `url_for()` generates a URL for a specific function or route, making it easier to refer to URLs in the application. It can also automatically generate URLs for dynamic routes with arguments.\n",
        "\n",
        "18. **How does Flask handle static files (CSS, JavaScript, etc.)?**  \n",
        "   Flask serves static files (like CSS, JavaScript, and images) from a folder named `static`. You can link to these files in your templates by referencing their URL with `url_for('static', filename='file_name')`.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. **What is an API specification, and how does it help in building a Flask API?**  \n",
        "   An API specification outlines the structure, endpoints, parameters, and expected responses for the API. It helps ensure consistency, guides development, and provides clear documentation for users.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. **What are HTTP status codes, and why are they important in a Flask API?**  \n",
        "   HTTP status codes indicate the result of an HTTP request. They are crucial for informing the client about the success or failure of a request. For example, `200 OK` indicates success, while `404 Not Found` indicates a missing resource.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. **How do you handle POST requests in Flask?**  \n",
        "   You can handle POST requests in Flask by defining a route and specifying the method as POST. For example:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   @app.route('/submit', methods=['POST'])\n",
        "   def submit_data():\n",
        "       data = request.form['data']\n",
        "       return jsonify({'received': data})\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "22. **How would you secure a Flask API?**  \n",
        "   Securing a Flask API involves using authentication (e.g., token-based authentication with JWT), HTTPS, proper validation of inputs, and limiting access to certain routes. Flask extensions like Flask-Login or Flask-JWT can help implement authentication.\n",
        "\n",
        "23. **What is the significance of the Flask-RESTful extension?**  \n",
        "   Flask-RESTful is an extension for Flask that simplifies building RESTful APIs. It provides tools for routing, request parsing, and formatting responses in a structured way. It also promotes the use of REST principles.\n",
